# Clockwork Highway
This is a couple of c# projects.

The first is a common library written using portable c# which implements the ecotricity API as it is documented in https://github.com/ScottHelme/Ecotricity-API

There's also an android app called 'Clockwork Highway' which uses the common library and can be used as a replacement for the ecotricity
app (but not for charging right now until there are converted chargers near me I can test on).

Also a windows testbed showing using the API in a desktop environment (just grabs the status of every known location and sticks it in a csv).

Everything can be compiled just with the free visual studio community edition.
